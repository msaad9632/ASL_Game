"""Maps WLASL glosses -> our game sign ids. WLASL glosses are lowercase single words.

WLASL adds signer diversity on top of ASL Citizen and includes EMERGENCY (which ASL Citizen
lacked). Only exact-concept glosses are mapped — synonyms that are different lexemes (e.g.
'hurt' vs 'pain') are excluded to keep labels clean. FEVER is in neither dataset.

⚠️ WLASL is non-commercial/research-licensed — training/experiments only; verify the license
before any commercial release (see CLAUDE.md).
