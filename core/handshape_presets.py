"""Phase 2 — Handshape preset library (the inverse of core.handshape).

The recognition side (`core.handshape`) reads 21 hand landmarks and scores how well they form a
named handshape. The synthesis side does the opposite: given a handshape NAME, it deterministically
*produces* a canonical set of 21 landmarks that the recognition predicates score highly. This is a
finite, one-time data task — exactly the "discrete data-lookup" the procedural-avatar report calls
for (Phase 2): the system never re-derives a handshape dynamically, it looks one up.

Because `core.handshape`'s predicates are built from rotation/translation-invariant distance ratios
(tip-vs-knuckle reach, thumb spread relative to hand scale), a preset only needs the right *radial*
finger geometry — it works regardless of where the arm later carries the hand in the frame. Phase 5
(`core.synthesis`) translates and orients these local poses into body-relative position.

Topology is the standard MediaPipe 21-point hand (see core.landmarks): wrist, then thumb
(cmc/mcp/ip/tip) and four fingers (mcp/pip/dip/tip). Local coordinates put the wrist at the origin
with the fingers pointing "up" the image (toward -y) and the palm toward the camera; z stays 0 so a
well-defined palm normal points at the camera.

Each entry of SHAPE_SPECS is (per-finger extension in [0,1] for index/middle/ring/pinky,
thumb_extended bool). 1.0 = fully extended, 0.0 = fully curled; intermediate values (the claw) sit
partway. These specs are the single source of truth shared by every sign that reuses the shape.
