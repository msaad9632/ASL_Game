"""Hospital scenario confusor regression tests.

Mirrors tests/test_coffee.py for every hospital movement sign. For each sign we replay two
committed fixtures through the SAME generic verifier:

  - <name>_correct.json  -> must PASS, with the movement parameter clearing its threshold.
  - <name>_confusor.json -> must FAIL, specifically because MOVEMENT is below threshold (the
    learner froze the correct pose). Handshape/location are NOT the reason it fails.

This is the real prevention mechanism for the single-frame bug: if anyone later weakens a
movement check or the schema guard, these tests fail loudly. Fixtures that have not been recorded
yet are skipped (so the suite stays green during incremental recording), but a sign whose
`correct` fixture exists MUST also ship a `confusor`, and vice-versa.

Record fixtures with:
    python -m tools.record_fixture --name help_correct  --seconds 3 --sign HELP
    python -m tools.record_fixture --name help_confusor --seconds 3 --sign HELP   # hold it FROZEN
