"""WATER sign definition.

ASL WATER: the "W" handshape (index + middle + ring extended) taps the fingertips to the chin
twice.

v1: "W" is recognised by finger count (three extended fingers); location reuses Saad's CHIN reach
(measured against the real mouth landmark); the two taps are a repeated motion. The W handshape +
chin makes this cleanly distinct from the other signs.

Parameters:
  handshape (dominant): "w" (three fingers)  [required]
  location: reaches chin height (Anchor.CHIN)[required]
  movement: repeated taps at the chin        [required]

    # 3-finger W + the chin location are unambiguous on their own.
