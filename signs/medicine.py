"""MEDICINE — repeated twisting movement over the non-dominant palm.

ASL MEDICINE: the non-dominant hand is an open, upward palm; the dominant hand (middle finger
toward the palm, approximated as a "claw" in v1) touches the palm center and rocks/twists back
and forth repeatedly. A single touch is not MEDICINE — the repetition is what identifies it.

Movement kind is REPEATED, so a static "claw over palm" pose fails on movement. The minimum
cycle count requires at least two full oscillations in the rolling window.

Parameters declared:
  handshape_dominant   : claw (middle-finger-toward-palm, approximated) [required]
  handshape_nondominant: open flat palm                                  [required]
  location             : dominant near the nondominant palm              [required]
  movement             : REPEATED twist/rock about the palm              [required]
  orientation          : nondominant palm up                             [not gated in v1]
