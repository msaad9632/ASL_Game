"""PLEASE sign definition.

PLEASE = a flat/open hand on the chest, rubbing in a circle. One hand, open palm (facing the
chest), circular movement. Movement is REQUIRED (it's a circular sign), so the schema guards it
the same way it guards COFFEE.

Parameters declared:
  - handshape (dominant): open / flat hand        [required]
  - location: neutral space (on the chest)        [required, loose]
  - movement: circular on the chest               [required]
  - orientation: palm toward the body (in)        [not required in v1]
