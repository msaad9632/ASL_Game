"""PAIN (HURT) — two index fingers converging toward each other.

ASL PAIN: both hands make a "1"/index handshape, fingertips pointing toward each other, and the
hands move toward each other near the body part that hurts. The verifiable feature for rule-based
v1 is the CONVERGENCE: the inter-hand gap must shrink over the rolling window.

Movement kind is CONVERGE (hospital addition to the engine), so holding two motionless index
fingers apart fails on movement — the same anti-bug guarantee as HELP, expressed with a
two-hand closing motion instead of a one-hand rise.

Parameters declared:
  handshape_dominant   : index finger extended        [required]
  handshape_nondominant: index finger extended        [required]
  location             : neutral space                [not gated — PAIN is signed at the hurt area]
  movement             : both hands CONVERGE          [required]  <- anti-bug gate
  orientation          : not gated in v1
