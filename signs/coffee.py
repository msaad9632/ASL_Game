"""COFFEE sign definition.

COFFEE = both hands in an S-handshape (a closed fist). The dominant fist circles (grinds) on
top of a stationary non-dominant fist, like grinding coffee beans. Movement is REQUIRED — this
is the sign whose single-frame check caused the original bug, so its definition is the canonical
proof that the schema now forces motion to be verified.

Parameters declared:
  - handshape (both hands): fist          [required]
  - location: dominant stacked just above the non-dominant fist, close together   [required]
  - movement: dominant circles about the non-dominant fist, >= ~300 deg total     [required]
  - orientation: dominant palm roughly down (grinding on top)                     [not required in v1]
