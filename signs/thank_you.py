"""THANK YOU sign definition.

THANK YOU = a flat/open hand starting at the chin/lips, moving forward and DOWN toward the
person. From a front-facing webcam the reliable 2D signal is the downward motion (the forward
component is along the camera axis and barely visible in 2D), so movement is a downward LINEAR
motion. Because the hand travels, location is checked as "did it REACH chin height" (its highest
point must be up at the chin) rather than an average position — a hand that starts below the chin
fails on location.

Parameters declared:
  - handshape (dominant): open / flat hand     [required]
  - movement: linear, downward                 [required]
  - location: reached chin height (Anchor.CHIN)[required]
  - orientation: palm up-ish                   [not required in v1]
