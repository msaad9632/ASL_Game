"""EMERGENCY — one-handed rapid repeated shake.

ASL EMERGENCY: an "E" handshape (approximated as a claw in v1) is held up and shaken rapidly
side to side. The defining features are repetition AND frequency — a slow single wave is not
EMERGENCY. A higher min_cycles requirement (vs MEDICINE's 2) and a shorter min_duration_s
enforce the "rapid" character.

One-handed, which distinguishes it from two-handed MEDICINE even though both use a claw and a
REPEATED movement.

Parameters declared:
  handshape_dominant: claw (E-hand approximation)    [required]
  nondominant       : none (one-handed)
  location          : neutral space                  [not gated — raised hand, varies]
  movement          : rapid REPEATED side-to-side    [required]  <- anti-bug gate
  orientation       : not gated in v1
