"""DIZZY sign definition.

ASL DIZZY: a hand circles in front of the face (a small loop), with an unfocused facial
expression selling it.

v1: gated as a clawed/loose hand up at the FACE making a CIRCULAR motion. The facial expression
(a non-manual marker) is NOT detectable from hand+pose landmarks, so it is described but ungated —
flagged for the future when NMM detection exists. The circle near the face distinguishes DIZZY
from the linear FEVER sweep.

Parameters:
  handshape (dominant): clawed / loose hand  [required]
  location: up in front of the face          [required]
  movement: a circular loop                  [required]
  NMM: unfocused expression                  [described, NOT gated in v1]
