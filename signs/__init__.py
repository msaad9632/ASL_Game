"""Shared sign definitions (pure data) — reused across all scenarios.

Import a sign directly or look it up by name in the SIGNS registry (handy for scenarios that
drive prompts by sign name). Coffee-shop signs and hospital signs all live here so both scenarios
share the same verifier without duplicating logic.
